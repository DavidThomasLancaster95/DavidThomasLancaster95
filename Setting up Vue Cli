You install vue cli with this tutorial here: https://github.com/BYU-CS-260/learning-vue-cli/blob/master/tutorials/lesson1.md

To create a new vue project just do: $ vue create whatever.

Make sure that you include a router. The presets are listed on that linked tutorial above ^

---------------------------------------------------------
Understanding what you just made

src/router/index.js - this important document routs your url traffic. When you create a new vue, update it here.

---------------------------------------------------------
The vues in the views folder. -> https://github.com/BYU-CS-260/learning-vue-cli/blob/master/tutorials/lesson2.md

Its pretty intuitive except for the script part.

If you use any components, you need to import them here and list them in the components section. You can use a compentent by putting it
in its own little bracket. <MyComponent msg="whatever"> // the msg lets you pass data across.

a component is like a vue, its data, props, is set by the message sent through the bracket.

also, the style in components is scoped so it doesn't screw with your other bits. 

the menu is src/App.vue. seems pretty intuitive. 

main.js is the js for the whole program. if you're not going to use a database, you can store global variables here. 

gives good detail -> https://github.com/BYU-CS-260/learning-vue-cli/blob/master/tutorials/lesson3.md

data can be accessed with 'this.$root.$data' this is the magic way to access all of your global variables
